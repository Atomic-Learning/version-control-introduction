<p>A version control system is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking changes, maintaining a history of modifications, and enabling the ability to revert to previous versions if needed. Popular version control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial.</p>

<p>These systems facilitate branching and merging, allowing developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work, before integrating their changes back into the main codebase.</p>

<p>Version control systems are essential for modern software development, particularly for larger projects or teams, as they enhance collaboration, accountability, and streamline the development process. They are still useful tools for individual developers to manage their own code changes effectively.</p>
